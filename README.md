# [ralin.net](http://www.ralin.net/) - my personal website

My digital space contains some information about me and my blog. It is built using open source software and tools like Ruby on Rails, Sass, jQuery, CoffeeScript, PostgreSQL and Vim. It is deployed on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/), the PaaS by Red Hat, running on Passenger inside Apache. Its source code is completely open. You can get familiar with the code and use any snippet you like, or follow my approach to any problem you face. In case you need a similar website (a few static pages and a simple personal blog), then simply fork this repo, change the content and styles to your likes and deploy.
