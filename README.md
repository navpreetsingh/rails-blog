# [ralin.net](http://www.ralin.net/) - my personal website 

Contains information about me and my blog. The website is split in two: the static pages and the blog application. It is built using open source software like Ruby, Rails, jQuery, Sass, Bootstrap and PostgreSQL. It is hosted on OpenShift, the Red Hat PaaS, running on Passenger inside Apache. 

## Why I `build` it vs. `generate` it?

I know there are plenty of ready-made gems, Rails engines, site generators, blog engines, but nonetheless I decided to build my e-home from scratch as I want to keep it clean and simple. I want to be able to change anything and customize everything. I want to choose my application stack and dependencies. I do NOT want to bear the burden of needless complexity and configuration most thrid-party solutions bring in.

## How to build a personal website in Ruby on Rails 

This repository could be used as a sample and as a guide. The source code is a Ruby on Rails application that you can use as a sample to build your own website. You can follow the commits history to see how I have built everything from scratch in small steps. You are welcome to browse the code, learn from it and use any part that you like in your own website. I regularly rebase interactively the whole commit history trying to make it clearer and easier to follow. 

## Contributing

The open source is about learning and sharing. To contribute to my website you can do a code review on any part of it. Point out code that smells. Propose better approaches with pull requests or comments. If you like any part of it then star the repository or just drop me a line. I appreciate all feedback.
