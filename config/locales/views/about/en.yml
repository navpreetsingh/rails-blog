      title: About
      overview: I am a software engineer mostly interested in developing practical web applications and services. I've been writing software since 1998. As of late I use mainly Ruby and JavaScript to build stuff. Still I am open to any technology that is proved suitable for the particular business need. In my spare time I contribute to open source projects as I believe that open source is the right way to build world-class applications. I am obsessed with writing simple code that is easy to read and understand. I do not always succeed in crafting clean code but I've never stopped trying and improving.
